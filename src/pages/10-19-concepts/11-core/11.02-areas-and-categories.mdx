# Areas and categories

Let's look again at the format of our numbers. It's crucial that you understand _why_ they look like they do.

## The complete Johnny.Decimal number

Just as a reminder, every Johnny.Decimal number looks like this.

<Areas1-random-numbers />

In words, we have any two digits, followed by a decimal point, followed by two more digits.

## Group things together (categories)

Johnny.Decimal is all about **grouping similar things together**, so let's start to do that.

<Areas2-group-them-together />

## Do it again (areas)

That's starting to look more like something organised and a bit less like a bunch of random numbers. Let's take it one step further.

<Areas3-do-it-again />

# Of course, we've done this backwards

When we decide to organise something with Johnny.Decimal, we don't _start_ with a bunch of numbers.

We start like this:

- First, we divide everything in our system in to (at most) ten large buckets of stuff. We call those our **areas**, and we assign each area a range like `10-19`, `20-29` … `90-99`.
- Then, within each area, we break things up again in to (at most) ten more buckets. We call them **categories** and we assign them numbers like `11`, `12` … `19`.
- Finally, we assign each individual thing in our system to a category, and give it a unique number. We start at `.01` within each category, and work our way up through the numbers.

Let's use a small company as an example, and write it out without the numbers.

<Areas5-small-company-step1 />

All we really do with Johnny.Decimal -- and if at this point you've realised this and are thinking, "hang on, all he's done is put numbers in front of things," well then you're not far wrong -- is put numbers in front of things.<FootRef n={1} />

**But this transforms the way you think about and use everything.** Trust me.

Let's put numbers in front of the system we just built above.

<Areas6-small-company-step2 />

## So long, cursed alphabet

What does this achieve? For one, it's removed our dependence on the alphabet. The alphabet is a fine thing but it's a terrible way to sort your files because things move around.<FootRef n={2} />

Today we have:

<Areas7-alphabetical-folders />

and tomorrow the exports department come along and do this:

<Areas8-new-exports-folder />

…and `Finance` isn't the second thing in the list any more. This sounds like a small thing, but <strong>it makes it impossible for your brain to learn where something will be.</strong>

# The Johnny.Decimal version

This is better:

<Areas9-this-is-better />

Because our folders all start with a number, they'll sort in a very predictable way. This concept applies throughout the system.

## 20, 60, 30, 90?

At this point you might be wondering, well, why is `Finance` all of the numbers from `20-29` and why is `Exports` `40-49`? What do those numbers <em>mean</em>?

And the answer is that they mean nothing. They're just numbers. `40` isn't better or worse than `20`.

# In summary

On this page I've talked mostly about the way that we structure our areas and categories. By now you should have a good high-level understanding. You have categories of things and each category belongs to one area only. Areas group categories together.

All of this happens <em>before the decimal</em>. Those two digits of the number <strong>are the category</strong>, and the first digit of the number tells you which area it's in.

What we've done here is organise a bunch of 'stuff' in to something with structure; we've created, essentially, a very simple database.
