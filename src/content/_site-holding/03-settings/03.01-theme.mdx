# {frontmatter.title}

I'll create a 'dark mode' theme for this site once everything else is done. That setting will be here when it exists.

## I've hacked it for now

I've done a [quick 'n dirty CSS trick](https://dev.to/pqina/poor-man-s-dark-mode-using-css-filter-211n) that should give you a 90% decent dark mode with basically no effort.

There's no toggle yet: it follows your system's dark mode setting.

When I find myself with an abundance of time I'll do this properly. Don't hold your breath. ;-)
