## Email

My email address is **&lt;hello&gt;** at **&lt;this domain&gt;**. Sorry it isn't linked, the spambots will get me.

I do read all mail, but if you have a question about your setup -- how to start, what sort of structure you should have, exactly how I would organise your _Magic: The Gathering_ card collection -- you're far more likely to receive a response from me if you post a question on [the forum](/20-29-communication/21-forums-and-chat/23.01-the-forum/). That way everyone else can learn from it as well.

## Social media

I no longer use social media regularly.

I'll post site updates to my [Mastodon account](https://hachyderm.io/@johnnydecimal) but I find that I'm a happier person if I don't get involved in conversations there. Nothing personal. [It's not you, it's me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAj4wBIU-8)

## Message me

Call me a crazy person, but my phone number is [+61 415 658 257](sms://+61415658257). Feel free to call or message but see above re: preferring the forum.

I'm in Australia but if I'm asleep it's on silent so don't worry about the time of day.
