We have a Discourse forum at [https://forum.johnnydecimal.com](https://forum.johnnydecimal.com).

If you have questions or need help, this is the best place to ask. Personally I prefer it to the [Discord](/20-29-communication/23-forums-and-chat/23.02-discord/): the information is more persistent in a forum.

## Forum maintenance

I generally update the forum software every other [Sunday afternoon, Australian Eastern time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20230430T040000&p1=57).

This can make the forum inaccessible for 15 minutes. If the forum link is timing out at this time, this is why.
