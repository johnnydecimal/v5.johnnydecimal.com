It would really help me to understand why you're here, what you were looking for, and what else you might need.

I [made this site my job](/20-29-communication/22-blog/22.00.0003-i-quit-my-job/) in May 2023 and your answers here can help me grow Johnny.Decimal and make it a sustainable business.

I've left this really open and unstructured as I'm just after your thoughts. Feel free to write as much or as little as you like. Don't worry about crafting some perfect response: just write.

**All fields are optional.** If you give me your email address I will assume it's okay if I reply if I have questions. _(You will **not** be signed up to the [mailing list](/20-29-communication/21-send-and-receive/21.02-mailing-list/).)_

Only I see the responses. Check out the [privacy policy](/00-09-site-administration/01-about/01.03-privacy/#survey-responses).

Thanks. I appreciate it.
