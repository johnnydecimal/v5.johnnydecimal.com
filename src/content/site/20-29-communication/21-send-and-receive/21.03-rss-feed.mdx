The site has one. Your feed reader should discover it.

If it doesn't pick it up, the URL is https://johnnydecimal.com/rss.xml.

## Components don't render

As of 12 May 2023 Astro's built-in methods for building an RSS feed don't support rendering of 'components' in the feed.

This site uses components for a bunch of stuff: if you see anything that isn't just plain text, it's probably a component.

This includes images, as I render them using a component.

I will fix this -- I want the feed to be first-class -- but it's not at the top of my priority list. (I'm kinda hoping Astro builds it before I have to do it myself.)

Until then, you'll need to click through to view the page on the site. Sorry.
