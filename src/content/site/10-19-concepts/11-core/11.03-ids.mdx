# {frontmatter.title}

Let's get on to the decimal.

We have a category — let's say `22 Contracts` — and we want to store some things there.

We create a Johnny.Decimal number by adding a decimal point to our category, and starting at number `.01`.

We start at `.01` and not just `.1` because of the way that computers sort files. Also it's more consistent, and consistency is elegant.

<p class="large-number">`22.01`</p>

Now we just decide what we're keeping there and give it a nice name.

<p class="large-number">`22.01 Cleaning contract`</p>

Later, we need to store another contract. What to do? Just use the next number.

<p class="large-number">`22.02 Office lease`</p>

## That was easy

You create a full Johnny.Decimal number by choosing a category and **looking for the next available number after the decimal.**

The thing to remember here is that the number after the decimal has _no meaning whatsoever:_ we just start at `.01` and work our way up.

## "What happens when I get to 99?"

You never will. And if you do, the category you defined was almost certainly too broad. Split it up.

## Give your Johnny.Decimal items simple names

This system lets us give concise names to things, because we already know from the number which category they're in.

I created `22.01 Cleaning contract` because it's short and reads well, but you could have gone with `22.01 Cleaning` if you'd preferred. You're already in a folder called `Contracts`.

**Everything that starts with** `22` **is a contract**.

# IDs group by created date

This solves another of our problems with the alphabet.

More often than not we want to view items that were created around the same time close to each other. At home I have `16 Travel` and it provides a nice example.

If my trips sorted alphabetically, they'd look like this.

<img srcset="/img/11.03-travel-before.gif 2x" />

That looks neat, but it's no use at all. Half of those trips are in the distant past. I'd like to keep them as an archive, but I don't care about them _now_.

This is more useful.

<img srcset="/img/11.03-travel-after.gif 2x" />

Now things that occur together appear together, and you can immediately jump to the stuff that's relevant now.

Note that my trips don't even necessarily appear in the order that I took them. They appear in the order that I _planned_ them.
