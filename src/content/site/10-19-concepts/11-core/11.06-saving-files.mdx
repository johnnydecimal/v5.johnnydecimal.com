# {frontmatter.title}

We've created areas containing categories and in those categories we have Johnny.Decimal numbers. We're now ready to hold our actual things.

**This is where your stuff lives.** This is where you keep your spreadsheets and your Word documents and your scanned receipts and your notes and references and emails and whatever else you keep in your system.

## Ooh, pretty

<SavingFiles1 />

## Never ever do this

# Nothing is more than two levels deep

**You must not create a folder inside a Johnny.Decimal folder.**

If you do, you've created chaos. You might _think_ that this is innocent enough – you might even wonder how else you would do it.

<SavingFiles4 />

Those artefacts don't live in isolation. They're part of your business and they deserve their own home. You know what happens otherwise – a year later, someone wants a picture from that photo shoot, but nobody remembers where it is because it's buried in this un-numbered folder.

There are of course exceptions to this rule, which we'll get to.

## This costs you real money

You lose stuff. You spend ridiculous amounts of time finding stuff. You duplicate stuff. Or you look stupid because you use stuff that is out of date.

**Stop it.**
