Before we go any further it's worth reinforcing the philosophy behind all of this. Because the numbers look cool, but ... what was the point again?

This is all a waste of time if it doesn't help you find things **quicker, more reliably,** and with **less stress** than you can today.

**Nothing else matters.**

On [the forum](/20-29-communication/23-forums-and-chat/23.01-the-forum/) people often want to tweak the way they use their Johnny.Decimal setup. I don't mind: use this as a guide and adapt it as you please.

But my core advice is always the same: do whatever you need to do _so that you can find your stuff again_.

# Why the 10 folders thing is important

We've all seen shared drives that look something like this. I've seen systems with _dozens_ of folders at the top level.

<img srcset="/img/11.04-hotmess.gif 2x" />

Anything could be anywhere! And it doesn't get better the deeper you go, it's chaos all the way down.

There is no chance of you finding anything in a system like this, and every chance that the thing you _do_ eventually find isn't the correct or only copy.

## Johnny.Decimal limits your choices

When you encounter a Johnny.Decimal system -- even one you've never seen before -- you are presented with, at most, ten choices: the **areas** that have been defined.

<JDBlock
  text={`
10-19 Finance and accounts
20-29 Products
30-39 ...and so on
`}
/>

Assuming your areas have been named sensibly, this makes it almost impossible to choose the wrong path. This applies whether you're opening or saving a file.

And when you go a level deeper, you're still limited to ten things: your **categories**.

<JDBlock
  text={`
10-19 Finance and accounts
   11 Budget
   12 Expenses
   13 Accounts
20-29 Products
   21 Drawings
   22 Photography
30-39 ...and so on
`}
/>

These limitations help you to be sure that you're looking in the right place, and that you're _not_ looking in the wrong place.

We can further improve discoverability by using [an index](/10-19-concepts/11-core/11.05-the-index/), which we talk about on the next page.

## A little friction can be a good thing

When you _don't_ use numbers, it's easy to create a new folder. You just ... create one.

At the area and category level, it shouldn't be that easy. Creating a new category should be something that you consider at least momentarily.

Giving them numbers, and limiting your availability to 10, forces you in to this moment of consideration.

Once you're down at your ID level, it doesn't matter so much. You're in a category. You are, by my definition, organised. Create away.

# Setup time is repaid later

Setting this up is certainly not free from a time perspective. You need to plan and maintain your system. It doesn't manage itself.

But this time that you spend is paid back many times over by the reduction in friction _every time_ you go to open or save a file.
