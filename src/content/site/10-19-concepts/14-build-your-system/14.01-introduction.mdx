To build your own system, it should now be clear that you need to:

- Break everything up in to, at most, ten areas.
- Break those areas up in to, at most, ten categories.<FootRef n={1} />
- Assign numbers to those areas and categories.
- Start creating items and assigning Johnny.Decimal IDs.
- Track your numbers somewhere.

It isn't much more complicated than that.

## Advice: don't rush the process

I've done this a lot and the best piece of advice I can give is: **take your time.**

When you start a new system, you don't know what you don't know. It takes time to recognise patterns and understand the scope of the task at hand.

If you rush in, you'll create categories that are too broad or narrow. You'll mis-categorise things. You'll miss things.

You'll end up having to change it later, which is possible, but not ideal.

Most of my systems are with me for a couple of years. Many last a lot longer. Take the time at the start to get it right.

# Step 1: write _everything_ down

Your first goal is to get everything out of everyone's brains. And I mean _everything:_ the more the better at this stage. If in doubt, write it down.

I find it easier if you're already planning, or working on, a project. If you haven't started it's more difficult. (Also, this means it's never too late to get organised.)

Write down everything that you do. Whenever a new thing comes up that you haven't written down, make a new note.

These notes only need to be short: one line. Just enough to jog your memory when you review them later.

## Use sticky notes, or a mind map

During this period of discovery you need a frictionless way to record all of these notes.

Sticky notes work great. They're easy to re-arrange later and there's nothing quicker than a sticky note and a pencil.

Stick them on the wall of your office and let everyone add to them.

My favourite electronic solution is a mind map. I _love_ [MindNode](https://www.mindnode.com) for Apple's platforms. If you have recommendations for other platforms, [let me know](/00-09-site-administration/02-send-and-receive/02.01-contact-me/).

If you use a mind map, don't be tempted to organise things yet. Just write it all down in a big flat list.

## Involve the whole team

If you're doing this for a project at work, don't do it in isolation.

More people = more ideas. At this stage, more is better. Involve everybody.

A cool boss lets everyone cover their office wall in sticky notes.

## Minimum: 1 week

Do _not_ spend less than a week on this step.

When you run out of new things to write down, you're finished. Not before.

## Example

Here's how your project would look if all the things were emoji. You've spent a week sticking notes to your wall.

<img class="no-invert" srcset="/img/14.01-emoji-chaos.jpg 2x" />

Fun! But also chaos. Quickly, find the turtle. Now pretend the turtle is your project schedule. Not so fun any more.

This is life without Johnny.Decimal. Thank goodness you're here.

# Step 2: group things together

The next step is to group similar things together. Let this happen naturally: don't have the concept of _areas_ or _categories_ or whatever else in mind.

Just bring things together that feel like they should be together.

<img class="no-invert" srcset="/img/14.01-emoji-step1.jpg 2x" />

This is why sticky notes or mind maps work so well.

## There's no 'right way' to do this

You will doubtless find a few different ways to organise your items.

We've gone with colours as the first level of organisation here, but we could also have chosen animals, people, and symbols. Or round, square, and random shapes. Or some other way.

Choose what feels natural. Involve the team. Build consensus. (Not _everybody_ has to agree. At some point you just have to make a decision.)

Again, you don't have to rush this. Sort things and sleep on it.

# Step 3: do it again

Now that we've grouped things once, do it again.

<img class="no-invert" srcset="/img/14.01-emoji-step2.jpg 2x" />

And there we have it: a Johnny.Decimal structure.

## Now find that turtle

Your ~~turtle~~ project schedule is now much easier to find, and has a unique ID number that you can use everywhere.

**Boss:** "Hey Ruby, where's the schedule?"  
**You:** "Twenty-two oh-four."

Oh yeah.
