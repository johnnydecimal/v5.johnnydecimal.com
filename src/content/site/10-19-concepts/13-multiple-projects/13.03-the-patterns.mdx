# The patterns

One size rarely fits all, and this is no exception. There are a number of multiple projects patterns that each of your projects may fit in to.

## Distinguishing features

What makes a pattern?

It is a combination of:

- The number of projects that you are likely to require over your Johnny.Decimal lifetime.
- The size of each of these projects; that is, how many total IDs each contains.
  - These two variables are inversely correlated: if you have many projects, each will necessarily be small.
- Whether your projects look similar, or whether each is different from the others.

I will outline each of these patterns here, and expand on each individually in the coming pages.

## Freelancer/creative agency

This pattern is defined by:

1. The large number of projects.
2. The similarity of each project to the others.

If you are a freelance creative, or if you run a creative agency, you likely have many clients, each with many jobs.

The size of the jobs will vary from small to large.
