Your inbox looks something like this. It's a shambles.

<img srcset="/img/12.01-outlook-crop2-disorganised.webp 2x" />

The problem is that processing every email takes time. You need to [context switch](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=context+switching&ia=web) for every thread.

What was it about? _Who sent it?_ Is that person important? _What else do I know about this topic?_ Do I have any actions? _What do I do with the email now?_

## I can fix your email

My inbox looks something like this.

<img srcset="/img/12.01-outlook-crop-jdfolders.webp 2x" />

Items are organised in to Johnny.Decimal folders. Rather than my default view being an 'inbox' whose contents are dictated by others, mine is an organised view of my unread messages **by Johnny.Decimal ID**.

Using custom Outlook views and rules my email is made manageable.

Messages in existing conversations get sorted in to their folders. The unsorted 'inbox' becomes a handful of messages a day rather than dozens.

I name those folders. They make sense to _me_, not to the sender.

I decide when I look at emails related to a particular topic. If I don't want to see them, they're easy to hide.

This allows me to focus. I'm in control.

# Make your Subject: work for you

There must be some sort of medical condition to describe the terrible dyslexia that overcomes people when they type email subjects. Here's a real example from an old job:

<EmailSubject_before />

Talk about the time it takes to context switch! What is my brain supposed to do with that?

## Put the Johnny.Decimal number in the subject line

This might sound mad, but it works.

Just put the relevant number in the subject line, and here's the special sauce: put it in **[square brackets]**. So my subject line becomes:

<EmailSubject_after />

## Why?

The brackets around the numbers in the subject help your email's search function pinpoint exactly what you want.

The text `72.02` might appear in a spreadsheet, or in someone's phone number. The text `[72.02]` almost certainly does not.

For example, you want to find that email related to the additional cabling. You either:

- know that `72.02` is the number you need, or
- use [your index](/10-19-concepts/11-core/11.05-the-index/) to look up the Johnny.Decimal number for 'structured cabling'.

If the email isn't already in a folder labelled `72.02`, just search for `[72.02]`.

This has never failed me. **People ask me about an email and when I find it five seconds later, they say to me, "wow â€¦ how did you do that?"**

## "But I write useful Subject: lines!"

That might be the case. _You_ do. But nobody else does.

With this system you can **add your own tag to someone else's email.** And because it's plain text in the subject line, it'll follow the email around and return to you. In my experience, nobody notices it's there.

## Help other people

If I've sorted my email in to folders, why would I need to search for a number?

I might not need to, but I've used these numbers-in-subject countless times when reminding my boss to approve my timesheet. Sure, he can search for my name and 'timesheet'. But searching for `[14.11]` is quicker and unambiguous.
