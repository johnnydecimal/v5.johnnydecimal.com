To make life easier throughout the rest of this site, I use the `AC.ID` notation to refer to any generic Johnny.Decimal system.

## Area Category ID: `AC.ID`

The Johnny.Decimal number is made up of your area/category combo before the decimal, then the ID after.

When I refer to `AC.ID`, I mean **any number in your system.**

`AC.33` is ID `.33` in any category.

`54.ID` is any ID in category `54`.

## Project Area Category ID: `PRO.AC.ID`

When we introduce [multiple projects](/10-19-concepts/13-multiple-projects/13.01-introduction/) the notation is extended to `PRO.AC.ID`.
