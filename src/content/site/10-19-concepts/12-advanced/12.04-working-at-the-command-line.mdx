# {frontmatter.title}

The structured nature of the Johnny.Decimal numbering system lets you move to any folder with the minimum number of keystrokes using tab completion.

At each level, you know with certainty that there will be no conflicting items.

<TerminalTabCompletion />

## Script your way around

Easier still, use a simple bash script to change to any directory immediately. Put this in your `.zshrc` or equivalent.

<JDBlock
  text={`
.zshrc
&nbsp;
cdj() {
  # Update with your document root folder
  pushd ~/Documents/*/*/\$\{1\}*
}
&nbsp;
export cdj
`}
  classArray={["highlight highlight-underline"]}
/>

And now switch to any directory instantly with `cdj 42.01`.

# Awesome List

I'll build an [awesome list](https://github.com/topics/awesome) of third-party scripts and other tools over on GitHub shortly.

It'll be at [github/johnnydecimal/awesome-johnnydecimal](https://github.com/johnnydecimal/awesome-johnnydecimal), which already exists if you want to star it. I need to tidy it up.
