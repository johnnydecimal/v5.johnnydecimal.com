# {frontmatter.title}

You may be wondering why we started our areas at `10-19` and not `00-09`, and our categories at `11` rather than `10`.

Why don't we use these numbers?

## Reserve them for the system

Sometimes you want to keep information _about the system_, in the
system.

I use area `00-09` for this and call it `System`.<FootRef n={1} />

I also store common items in this area that don't fit elsewhere. Here's the structure I often use. Feel free to copy or adapt it.

<JDBlock
  text={`
00-09 System
   00 Index
   01 Inbox
   02 Notes
   03 To do & checklists
   04 Bookmarks
   05 Templates
   06 [unused]
   07 [unused]
   08 Someday
   09 Archive

#### `00 Index`

- If I'm using the ['single file as my index' method](/10-19-concepts/11-core/11.05-the-index/#2-one-file-with-all-of-your-ids), that file is always called `00.00 Index`.
- In a [future post](/90-99-behind-the-scenes/98-hidden-website-pages/98.11-in-a-future-post/) I'll expand on the idea of having this ID be the 'front door' for your project.

#### `01 Inbox`

- A place to put stuff that you know you'll sort in the future.
- I tend to use this when I'm starting out: it's better to put unorganised stuff here temporarily than on your Desktop.
- Be careful! You know you need to organise this stuff at some point. Don't be lazy.
- This is an idea taken from [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/)&reg;.

#### `02 Notes`

- While you should usually store your notes under their own Johnny.Decimal ID -- the note relates to _something_ -- it can be handy to have a project-wide notes category.
- Use sparingly.

#### `03 To do & checklists`

- A place to keep your to do lists and [checklists](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/).

#### `04 Bookmarks`

- I find it easier to have bookmarks in one place versus throughout my system: that is, if I'm saving them in a text file.
- If you can link them to an ID (or even a category), you should prepend the proper Johnny.Decimal number to your browser bookmark.

#### `05 Templates`

- Sometimes I'll store things I use as templates here.
- Some systems lend themselves to repeatability. I'll explain this further [in a future post](/90-99-behind-the-scenes/98-hidden-website-pages/98.11-in-a-future-post/).

#### `08 Someday`

- 'Someday' is another idea borrowed from GTD&reg;.
- This is for things that you want to do 'someday' but not now.
- It's a little like `01 Inbox`, but you _know_ that you're not going to deal with it in the immediate future.
- You should review this periodically.

#### `09 Archive`

- Somewhere to throw stuff you no longer need.
- Although I generally do _not_ recommend archiving entire sections of your system. I'll expand on this in [a future post](/90-99-behind-the-scenes/98-hidden-website-pages/98.11-in-a-future-post/).

## Similarly for categories 10, 20 ... 90

In our small company example, `20-29` was `Administration` but our first category was `21 Company registration`. What happened to `20`?

We reserve these numbers for 'system' information _about the category_. Although I hardly ever use them, it's rare that I have more than nine categories in an area. I don't miss the wasted number, but I always appreciate it when I need it.

# Confused? Don't worry

If you want to use the zeros, use them. It doesn't matter.
