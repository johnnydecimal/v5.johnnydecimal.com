There are situations where it makes sense to break the rules.

## Storing things with dates in them

An example from my life: I sent weekly timesheets to a company I worked for. Category `14 Timesheets & expenses` is where I kept them.

I thought about creating a new number for each week's timesheets, which would have looked like this:

<img srcset="/img/12.02-finder-14.01-timesheets-folder-before.gif 2x" />

I would have needed to [track those numbers](/10-19-concepts/11-core/11.05-the-index/) -- an overhead I didn't need. **The system is meant to make my life easier.**

### Folders inside Johnny.Decimal folders

I told you not to do this. I am not to be trusted.

Here's how my timesheets folder looks:

<img srcset="/img/12.02-finder-14.01-timesheets-folder-after-highlighted.gif 2x" />

I've created `YYWW` folders<FootRef n={1} /> inside `14.01 Weekly timesheets`. I did this because **it makes more sense this way.**

`2319` is a better way to represent 'the 19th week of 2023' than `14.19`, and it sorts chronologically.

My timesheets are still in one place. I haven't broken the Johnny.Decimal system because everything is still very organised.

## Emailing my weekly timesheet

When I email my weekly timesheet to the boss, I use the following subject line:

<EmailSubjectWithYYWW />

I'm extending the [use Johnny.Decimal numbers in your email subject](/10-19-concepts/12-advanced/12.01-managing-email/) concept by putting the full number, including the `YYWW` bit, in the subject. Our number has grown, but **that's okay because it's still very structured.**

This allows me -- or the boss -- to find any timesheet instantly. Search in Outlook for `[14.01.2319]` and the _only_ thing that appears is my timesheet for this specific week.

This is incredibly useful when I have to remind him to approve it so that I can get paid. (He gets far too much email and, unfortunately, I'm the only one that sends it to him already categorised.)

## Archiving files

I need to keep old copies of files. Say it's a spreadsheet that I'm updating, but I want to keep the previous version in case I mess it up.

This is also an exception to the 'you can't create a folder inside a Johnny.Decimal folder' rule. In this case, feel free to create a folder called `archive` and move things in to it.

## Exporting files

Similarly I often need to send someone a point-in-time export of a file. A schedule on a specific date, say.

These go in an `exports` folder and I always append the date to the filename.

<img srcset="/img/12.02-finder-12.02-exports.gif 2x" />

  footnotes={[
    "I use &lsquo;year-week&rsquo; as my date format for this sort of thing because it sorts chronologically, so <code>2301</code> was the first week of 2023.",

/>
