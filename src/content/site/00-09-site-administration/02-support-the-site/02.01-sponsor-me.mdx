Johnny.Decimal was born more than 10 years ago. Since then I've put thousands of hours of work into it.

I've done all this in my spare time. I am motivated by, and dedicated to, this idea.

**I quit my job on 8 May 2023 so I can work on this. This website is now my job.**

The basic Johnny.Decimal system will always be free. But if you'd like to support me while I work hard to make it bigger and better, you're amazing.

The first 100 patrons receive a limited-edition Johnny.Decimal sticker!

Thank you.

## Prefer a one-off thing?

Had a few too many drinks and feeling generous? [Just give me a hundred dollars via Stripe](https://buy.stripe.com/bIY3dx4ph4BWedO000).<FootRef n={1} />

## Interested in learning Excel?

My partner and I spent much of 2022 creating an Excel course. We think it's really good. I teach her -- a total Excel newbie -- how to use Excel. It's called &lsquo;[Learn with Lucy](https://www.learnwithlucy.rocks/courses/excel)&rsquo;.

We spent ages planning the course. Everything she learned, she learned on camera. And now she can use Excel. So it works.

It's $47, but you'll actually get something for your money. We believe that at the end you'll understand Excel better than most people.

If you're already an expert, you could always buy it for a friend or family member.
