## The website code

The code that generates the website, **excluding the 'Johnny.Decimal system' content as described above,** is licenced under ISC.

I wouldn't recommend it -- I'm not a very good programmer -- but if you want to re-use any part of this code **without the Johnny.Decimal content,** go ahead.
