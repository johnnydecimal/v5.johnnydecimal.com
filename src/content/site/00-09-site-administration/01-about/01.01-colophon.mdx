This website was created by [Johnny Noble](/20-29-communication/21-send-and-receive/21.01-contact-me/)
in Canberra, Australia. The version you are reading is the fifth major version of
this site and it was created in early 2023.

Johnny.Decimal is me and my partner, Lucy. We tend to write this site in the back yard with our chickens. I came up with this idea in 2010, a story you should remind me to tell on the blog if I haven't already.

## Technical details

The site was hand-coded using [Astro](https://astro.build) and is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). I recommend both.

The delightful fixed-width typeface is [Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/), and the main typeface is [IBM Plex Serif](https://www.ibm.com/plex/).

## The name

My mate Alex came up with the name. Yes, it's a riff on the Dewey Decimal system.
