# {frontmatter.title}

I'm just a nerd building a site for a thing that I personally find useful. So when I say that "I take your privacy seriously", it's not just some spiel. It's me, Johnny Noble, talking to you, my honoured guest.

## Web trackers & cookies

I hate trackers more than you do. This site will **never** contain **any** third-party 'web trackers', i.e. code that attempts to uniquely identify you and follow you around the web.

This site has no need for cookies, and does not use them.

It uses no external fonts, e.g. Google Fonts, or any other system that might provide a subtle way to track you.

While JavaScript is used heavily in the production of this site, the as-published version that you are reading contains none.

## Server analytics

As this site is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com), they know how many people are visiting it. As the web host it's basically impossible for them _not_ to know.

I subscribe to [Netlify Analytics](https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/) which gives me a very high level view of how many people are visiting the site, and which country they're in.

## Your email address

If you choose to [give me your email address](/20-29-communication/21-send-and-receive/21.02-mailing-list/), I will treat it with the utmost respect. I'll never spam you, or give it to anyone else.<FootRef n={1} />

In 2019 I moved the mailing list from Mailchimp, whose business model had started to make me uncomfortable (and oh boy has it got worse since then) to [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email). It's run by one guy who I trust to do the right thing. I've turned off all analytics features, so I don't know who opens, clicks, or forwards my emails.

## Survey responses

If you're kind enough to [complete the survey](/20-29-communication/21-send-and-receive/21.04-survey/), the results are saved directly to my web host, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/). Only I ever see them, and only I will ever read them.

Periodically I'll download the form details and delete them from Netlify.
