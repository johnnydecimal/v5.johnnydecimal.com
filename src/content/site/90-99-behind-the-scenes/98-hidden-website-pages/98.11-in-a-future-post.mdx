# In a future post...

I'm still writing this site, and have a to-do list as long as my arm.

Rather than wait until it's 100% finished, I'm linking things that I know I _will_ write, but that don't exist yet, to this page.

If you're reading this, you've found one of those things.

For updates follow along via [RSS](/20-29-communication/21-send-and-receive/21.03-rss-feed/), sign up to the [mailing list](/20-29-communication/21-send-and-receive/21.02-mailing-list/), keep an eye on the [version](/00-09-site-administration/01-about/01.04-version/) page, follow me on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@johnnydecimal/), or just check back manually like it's [1999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rblt2EtFfC4).
