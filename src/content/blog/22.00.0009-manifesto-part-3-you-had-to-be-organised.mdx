When we kept everything on paper, you had to be organised. There was no other option.

If you weren't organised, the information was lost. Not lost as in 'it'll take me a while to find it': lost as in 'gone forever'.

Now you _can_ be disorganised, but at what cost? The cost is the time it takes you to find a thing; it is the risk that the thing that you find is a duplicate or an old version. It is the constant frustration that comes from knowing that something exists, but having no idea where it is.

We all feel this every day and we have come to believe that it is normal.

It is not normal.
