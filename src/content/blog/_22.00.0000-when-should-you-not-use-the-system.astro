The question 'how do I organise my music / video collection' comes up now and then on [the forum [23.01]](https://forum.johnnydecimal.com/).

This is one of those cases where I recommend that you _do not_ use Johnny.Decimal. It was developed to organise things that aren't naturally organised; to organise things that don't make sense alphabetically.

But your music and videos come already organised. The alphabet is _perfect_ for this. 'P' for _Pink Floyd_ comes before 'R' for _Roxy Music_. Don't mess with what already works.

## Photo collection

I feel similarly about your photo collection: **just use an app**. That's probably going to be one of Apple or Google's _Photos_ apps.

If you must organise them yourself on a hard drive -- perhaps you're a professional photographer -- I'd use dates for this sort of thing.

As always, use the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard `yyyy-dd-mm` so that they sort properly.
