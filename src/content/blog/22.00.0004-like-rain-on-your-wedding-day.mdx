Isn't it ironic that I thought [quitting my job](/20-29-communication/22-blog/22.00.0003-i-quit-my-job/) would give me _more_ time to work on the site, and instead I've done essentially nothing.

There's a good reason: money. The site earns none. I need some. :-)

So that's what I've been doing: planning how to make money. The plan is that it'll come from the corporate world. There is a plan, it'll just take a while to enact.

The site will always be free, and my dream is that I have income that allows me to spend a lot more time on it.

Until then, forgive the lack of updates. I need to kick-start the 'job' part of 'this is my job now'. Adding new pages here unfortunately does not do that.

In the mean time there are little threads that pop up on [the forum](https://forum.johnnydecimal.com/) that I try to stay on top of, so if you're hungry for more content, or have a burning question, that's where you should be.

And of course -- I won't keep banging this drum, I swear -- if you want to [sponsor me](/00-09-site-administration/02-support-the-site/02.01-sponsor-me/), every bit helps.
