How many conversations with old colleagues -- one of them just called me -- start, "hey do you remember where?.."

In this case he asked "do I remember where that server analysis that I did was stored?" And I said, yeah, it's on our customer's network. Thirty-two-dot-something, I think.

Then I realised that I still have my old [index](/10-19-concepts/11-core/11.05-the-index/) in Bear, so I opened up the phone and within thirty seconds there it was.

Thirty-two dot twelve.
