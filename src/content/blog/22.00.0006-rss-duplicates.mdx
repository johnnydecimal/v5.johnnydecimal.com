The link back to the site from items in the [RSS feed](/20-29-communication/21-send-and-receive/21.03-rss-feed/) has been incorrect.

I've fixed it now, but the thing that makes each entry unique is its URL: so now your RSS reader will probably see a bunch of 'new' articles, which are duplicates of the old articles. You can ignore them.

Sorry! Like I've said, I'm hand-coding this site. Like I might not have said, I'm not _actually_ a web developer by trade...
